# Hey I'm JosÃ©

Frontend web developer diving deep into technologies such as JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Next.js.

While initially started my programming journey with backend development, later I switched to frontend development, where I found the right calling.

With a diverse background - including a degree in Communcation and marketing, and the experience of owning a business in the hospitality industry - I bring a distinctive perspective to the table.

This experience has allowed me to understand the importance of strategic design for user engagement and the impact of technology on businesses.

I really like to create beautiful and functional web applications that resonates with the intended audience, and I am looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow.
